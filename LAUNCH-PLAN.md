## 🔥 EXECUTION NOTES

**Most Important:** Get first paying customer within 14 days to validate product-market fit.

**Key Insight:** Small businesses and consultants are drowning in CSV exports from various tools (Google Analytics, Shopify, QuickBooks) but have no easy way to visualize them for clients.

**Success Factor:** Focus on ease of use and speed over advanced features initially.

**The money is in recurring subscriptions + upselling to team plans.**
